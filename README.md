# Spring Boot 3 Unit Testing and Integration Testing

This repository provides examples and guidelines for unit testing and integration testing in Spring Boot 3 applications. The project is structured to demonstrate best practices and techniques for writing effective tests to ensure the quality and reliability of your Spring Boot applications.


## Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on testing individual units of code, typically at the method or class level, in isolation from other dependencies. In Spring Boot applications, you can use various testing frameworks like JUnit or TestNG along with Mockito for mocking dependencies.

The `src/test/java` directory contains examples of unit tests for different components of a Spring Boot application, including controllers, services, and repositories. Each test class is named with the convention `ComponentNameTest` to indicate which component is being tested.

## Integration Testing

Integration tests focus on testing the interactions between multiple components of your application, including the communication with external systems or services. Spring Boot provides utilities for creating integration tests, such as the `@SpringBootTest` annotation for loading the complete application context.

The `src/test/java` directory also contains examples of integration tests. Integration tests often involve starting up a test server, making HTTP requests to the endpoints, and asserting the responses. You can use frameworks like RestAssured or the Spring MVC Test framework for these tests.
